# Ionic Web View for Cordova

A Web View plugin for Cordova, focused on providing the highest performance experience for Ionic apps (but can be used with any Cordova app).

This plugin defaults to using WKWebView on iOS and the latest evergreen webview on Android. Additionally, this plugin makes it easy to use HTML5 style routing
that web developers expect for building single-page apps.

Note: This repo and its documentation are for `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` @ `2.x`, which uses the new features that may not work with all apps. See [Requirements](#requirements) and [Migrating to 2.x](#migrating-to-2x).

## Configuration

This plugin has several configuration options that can be set in `config.xml`. Important: some configuration options should be adjusted for production apps, especially `WKPort`:

### iOS and Android Preferences

Preferences available for both iOS and Android platforms

#### WKPort 

```xml
<preference name="WKPort" value="8080" />
```

The default port the server will listen on. _You should change this to a random port number!_

### iOS Preferences

Preferences only available for iOS platform

#### WKSuspendInBackground

```xml
<preference name="WKSuspendInBackground" value="false" />
```

Whether to try to keep the server running when the app is backgrounded. Note: the server will likely be suspended by the OS after a few minutes. In particular, long-lived background tasks are not allowed on iOS outside of select audio and geolocation tasks.

#### WKBind

```xml
<preference name="WKBind" value="localhost" />
```

The hostname the server will bind to. There aren't a lot of other valid options, but some prefer binding to "127.0.0.1"

#### WKInternalConnectionsOnly (New in 2.2.0)

```xml
<preference name="WKInternalConnectionsOnly" value="true" />
```

Whether to restrict access to this server to the app itself. Previous versions of this plugin did not restrict access to the app itself. In 2.2.0 and above,
the plugin now restricts access to only the app itself.

#### KeyboardAppearanceDark

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardAppearanceDark" value="false" />
```

Whether to use a dark styled keyboard on iOS

#### Proxy requests to avoid CORS errors

```xml
<wkproxy path="/api/" proxyUrl="https://www.domain.com/api/" sslCheck="default" useCertificates="mycert.der,mycert2.der" clearCookies="yes" />
```

All requests which starts with `/api/` will be forwarder to proxyUrl
(eg. https://www.domain.com/api/)

* `path` - path which will be proxied (all starts with that path)
* `proxyUrl` - where to forward
* `sslCheck` - (optional) mode of ssl `nocheck`, `default`, `pinned`
* `useCertificates` - (optional) comma separated `.der` files to use for the pining
* `clearCookies` - (optional) default `no`. If `yes` all cookies will be removed on app start

##### Proxy SSL Pining

There are 3 modes which can be set for the sslCheck

* `default` - (used by default). Check will be by iOS
* `nocheck` - will accept all certificates, even self-signed
* `pinned` - will accept connections only with provided DER certificates

The certificate files should be provided in the `www/certificates` directory

It is also possible to explicitly specify which certificates will be used by providing
there's names (comma separated) in the `useCertificates` attribute of `wkproxy`. If the `useCertificates`
is not provided, it will use all `.der` files.

How to get DER certificate from my server?

`openssl s_client -connect my-server.com:443 -showcerts < /dev/null | openssl x509 -outform DER > mycert.der`


##### Cookies

Cookies are stored on the native system and are not forwarded to the WKWebView.



## Plugin Requirements

* **iOS**: iOS 10+ and `cordova-ios` 4+
* **Android**: Android 4.4+ and `cordova-android` 6.4+

## Migrating to 2.x

1. Remove and re-add the Web View plugin:

    ```
    cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-ionic-webview
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@latest
    ```

1. Apps are now served from HTTP on Android.

    * The origin for requests from the Web View is `http://localhost:8080`.

1. Replace any usages of `window.Ionic.normalizeURL()` with `window.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc()`.

    * For Ionic Angular projects, there is an [Ionic Native wrapper](https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/native/ionic-webview):

        ```
        npm install @ionic-native/ionic-webview@beta
        ```
