# Ionic Web View for Cordova

A Web View plugin for Cordova, focused on providing the highest performance experience for Ionic apps (but can be used with any Cordova app).

This plugin uses WKWebView on iOS and the latest evergreen webview on Android. Additionally, this plugin makes it easy to use HTML5 style routing that web developers expect for building single-page apps.

Note: This repo and its documentation are for `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` @ `3.x`, which uses the new features that may not work with all apps. See [Requirements](#plugin-requirements) and [Migrating to 3.x](#migrating-to-3x).

2.x documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-plugin-ionic-webview/blob/2.x/README.md).

## Configuration

This plugin has several configuration options that can be set in `config.xml`.

### Android and iOS Preferences

Preferences available for both iOS and Android

#### Hostname

`<preference name="Hostname" value="app" />`

Default value is `localhost`.

Example `ionic://app` on iOS, `http://app` on Android.

If you change it, you'll need to add a new `allow-navigation` entry in the `config.xml` for the configured url (i.e `<allow-navigation href="http://app/*"/>` if `Hostname` is set to `app`).
This is only needed for the Android url when using `http://`, `https://` or a custom scheme. All `ionic://` urls are whitelisted by the plugin.

### Android Preferences

Preferences only available Android platform

#### Scheme

```xml
<preference name="Scheme" value="https" />
```

Default value is `http`

Configures the Scheme the app uses to load the content.


#### MixedContentMode

```xml
<preference name="MixedContentMode" value="2" />
```

Configures the WebView's behavior when an origin attempts to load a resource from a different origin.

Default value is `0` (`MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW`), which allows loading resources from other origins.

Other possible values are `1` (`MIXED_CONTENT_NEVER_ALLOW`) and `2` (`MIXED_CONTENT_COMPATIBILITY_MODE`)


[Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setMixedContentMode(int))


### iOS Preferences

Preferences only available for iOS platform

#### WKSuspendInBackground

```xml
<preference name="WKSuspendInBackground" value="true" />
```

Set to false to stop WKWebView suspending in background too eagerly.

#### KeyboardAppearanceDark

```xml
<preference name="KeyboardAppearanceDark" value="false" />
```

Whether to use a dark styled keyboard on iOS

## Plugin Requirements

* **Cordova CLI**: 7.1.0+
* **iOS**: iOS 11+ and `cordova-ios` 4+
* **Android**: Android 4.4+ and `cordova-android` 6.4+

## Migrating to 3.x

1. Remove and re-add the Web View plugin:

    ```
    cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-ionic-webview
    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic-webview@latest
    ```

1. Apps are now served from HTTP on Android by default.

    * The default origin for requests from the Android WebView is `http://localhost`. If `Hostname` and `Scheme` preferences are set, then origin will be `schemeValue://HostnameValue`.

1. Apps are now served from `ionic://` scheme on iOS.

    * The default origin for requests from the iOS WebView is `ionic://localhost`. If `Hostname` preference is set, then origin will be `ionic://HostnameValue`.

1. Replace any usages of `window.Ionic.normalizeURL()` with `window.Ionic.WebView.convertFileSrc()`.

    * For Ionic Angular projects, there is an [Ionic Native wrapper](https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs/native/ionic-webview):

        ```
        npm install @ionic-native/ionic-webview@beta
        ```
